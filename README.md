# xml-isogen

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/typeable/xml-isogen.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/typeable/xml-isogen)

TemplateHaskell generators for XML-isomorphic data types, including
instances for parsing and rendering. A convenient DSL to define those
types.

This is similar to XSD but is Haskell-specific.
